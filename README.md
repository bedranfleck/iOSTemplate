# iOSTemplate

iOS Template is a repo I created to teach iOS development to my friend @formiga1995 in an environment that is somewhat close to an industry environment in Brazil.
The main goal here is to teach him the basics in CocoaTouch framework, and also some good practices in a work environment.

We have decided to tackle the problem of creating a QRCode reader app with some built-in functionality to open websites and/or redirect deep-links, QRCode reading history with repeatable actions (saving a deep link or website for example) and an about tab containing info on the project and us.
